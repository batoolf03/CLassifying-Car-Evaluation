# CLassifying-Car-Evaluation
Data set available here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Car+Evaluation(this  link  also  has  the  description  of  the  data).  

This dataset has 1728 records, each record representing a car evaluation. Each car evaluation is described with 7 attributes. 6 of the attributes represent car characteristics, such as buying price, price of the  maintenance, number of doors, capacity in terms of persons to carry, the size of luggage boot, and estimated safety of the car. The seventh variable represents the evaluation of the car (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good). 
For this multi class problem, I have used Naive Bayes, KNN, Decision Tree, logisitic regression and SVM after tuning the optimal hyperparameters for every model to predict the evaluation of the cars based on their characteristics. Their performance would be compared based on the f1 score.
